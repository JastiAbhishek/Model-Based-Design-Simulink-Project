# Model-Based-Design-Simulink-Project
The project centers on utilizing Model-Based Design systems from the project's inception to System-in-the-Loop (SIL) testing. The primary goal is to approve at least 5 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) for integration into an automotive system. This involves crafting a Concept of Operations outlining the system's proposed concept and operational aspects. Subsequently, a detailed document encompassing Requirements and architecture, including a Block Diagram, will be developed to communicate high-level system expectations. Further, Detailed Design Diagrams, featuring Circuit Diagrams, will be created to offer a comprehensive low-level overview of the system's architecture. The final phase entails Module Design and Simulation using Simulink, where each component's physical or functional behavior is modeled and verified through simulation using test data. This process ensures that all components operate as expected within the designed system of choice.

# Roles / Responsibilities 
Systems Architect -> Developed a concept of operations outlining the proposed system's concept and operation aspects as well as defined high-level system expectations by creating requirements & architecture documents, which include block diagrams to communicate system architecture and functionality effectively.

Circuit Designer -> Created detailed design diagrams, focusing on circuit diagrams to provide a low-level overview of the system's architecture.

Simulink Modeler -> Utilized simulink to model the physical and functional behavior of individual components based on the detailed design specifications. Developed simulation models for each ECU and verified their behavior using test data to ensure they operated as expected within the designed system.

Quality Assurance Engineer -> Developed and executed test plans to validate the functionality and performance of the modeled components and the integrated system. Conducted system-in-the-loop (SIL) testing to verify the interactions between ECUs and ensured they aligned with the approved system requirements.

Documentation Specialist -> Created detailed and comprehensive documentation for the entire project, including ConOps. Requirements and architecture documents, Circuit Diagrams, and Simulink models.
